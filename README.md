# Garbage-image-classification
Designed and implemented a multi-phase machine learning pipeline to classify garbage into six categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash) for waste segregation and recycling. Utilized a custom neural network architecture in the initial phase, achieving 96.68% training accuracy but addressing overfitting challenges with a pretrained VGG-13 model in the second phase. Conducted extensive preprocessing, including image resizing and tensor conversion, and employed advanced deep learning frameworks like PyTorch to improve classification performance. This project underscored the potential of transfer learning in handling complex classification tasks and contributed to sustainable waste management efforts.
